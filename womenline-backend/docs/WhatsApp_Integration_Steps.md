*Stores the sent message in MongoDB (WhatsAppLog)

4. Logging
Type	Location
Event Logs	utils/logger.js
Audit Logs	utils/logAuditTrail.js

Sample Request (Twilio Webhook):

8. Routes Summary
| Method | Endpoint                              | Description                         | Auth  |

## Inbound WhatsApp Auto-Reply
Webhook Endpoint:
POST /api/whatsapp/inbound
Twilio will send a POST request to this endpoint whenever a user sends a message to your WhatsApp number.
Local Testing vs Production:
Local development: You need a tool like ngrok
 to expose your localhost. For example:
https://<random-ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/api/whatsapp/inbound
You then configure this URL in the Twilio Sandbox as the ‚ÄúWHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN‚Äù webhook.

Production (Render/Vercel/other): Your deployed app already has a public URL. You can set:
https://womenline-backend.onrender.com/api/whatsapp/inbound
in Twilio as the inbound webhook.
Twilio Sandbox Setup:
Go to your Twilio Console ‚Üí Programmable Messaging ‚Üí WhatsApp Sandbox
Set WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN to your webhook URL.
Twilio will now forward all inbound messages to your /inbound endpoint.
Handling Messages:
Your whatsappTestRoute.js already extracts the sender and message body:
let from = req.body.From;
let incomingMsg = req.body.Body;
Then it sends an auto-reply back via sendWhatsAppMessage(from, reply).

‚úÖ Key Takeaways
Yes, you must provide a URL to Twilio (ngrok for dev, Render URL for production).
Twilio calls this URL whenever a user messages your WhatsApp number.
Your existing /inbound route handles these messages and sends an auto-reply.
